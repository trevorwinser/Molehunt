# How to Install
Install the latest version of the datapack. Go into your world folder and place the zip file inside the datapacks folder and uncompress it. Finally, delete the original zip file.

# How to Start
When everyone loads into the game, a player with operator permissions needs to run the command: `/reload`. Players will then be given various customization options and the ability to start the game.

# How to Play
Molehunt is a simple game focusing on two teams: the moles, and the innocents. The mole's objective is to kill all the innocents before the time runs out. The innocent's objective is to survive until the time runs out. Simple as that.

# How to Enjoy the Game
All this datapack provides is a means to play the game, but to properly enjoy the game there are a few guidelines players should follow:
1. Only moles may use tab to see who's alive.
2. Use [Simple Voice Chat Mod](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod as a means of communication.
3. Actively engage with others during the game. Don't just crouch in a hole the entire time.
4. No headpiece armor slot. Makes PvP more possible.

# How to End
There are two conditions to ending the game:
1. All innocents die
2. The timer runs out

The current iteration requires at least one innocent be alive after the time is up in order for the innocents to win. This allows more interesting encounters between innocents if all the moles die early on. However, this can be skipped by having an operator run the command: `/function molehunt:end`
